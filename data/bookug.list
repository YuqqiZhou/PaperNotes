title=GPU acceleration of subgraph isomorphism search in large scale graph
author=Bo Yang, Kai Lu, Yinghui Gao, Xiaoping Wang, Kai Xu
journal=Journal of Central South University
year=2015
tags=subgraph isomorphism, backtrack paradigm, GPU, parallel
star=*
problem=how to apply TurboISO to GPU
interest=TurboISO is a fast CPU subgraph isomorphism algorithm, is it suitable for GPU?
hardness=TurboISO adopts backtrack paradigm which is hard to be parallelized
idea=parallelism in different candidate region, the independency property of the partial subtree embedding allows that the GPU region exploration algorithm can first divide the region exploration into expanding and backtracking of partial subtree embeddings and then conquer the partial subtree embedding and generate new ones in parallel
future=
comment=the key of this paper is to adopts some BFS expanding strategies in the DFS framework, the shortcoming is that lots of DFS operations still exist and will limit the overall performance; if dfs work is too little, then the size of candidates will be too large for GPUto run(memory and thread limits), if dfs work is too much, then the time cost of dfs is too high, though the size of candidates for BFS is reduced
other=backtrack paradigm is rarely used in parallel computing
